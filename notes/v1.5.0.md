# bloop `v1.5.0`

Bloop v1.5.0 is out! The main change in this release is migration to the newest
version of the Zinc incremental compiler. We also discontinued using
`~/.bloop/.jvmopts` to specify Bloop jvm opts, instead users should use
`~/.bloop/bloop.json` as explained in
[the documentation](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/docs/server-reference#global-settings-for-the-server)

## Installing Bloop
